# REDiffï¼špython scripts for identifying differential RNA editing events between different groups with small size RNA-seq dataset.

Introduction
============
<p align-text="justify"> ReDiff,  specialized software for the human species, enables comprehensive RNA editing level analysis from raw fastq files. The tool efficiently prepares reference data, computes editing levels within individual samples, and compares events across distinct groups. False discovery rate correction ensures statistical rigor, enhancing outcome precision and interpretability. Finally, ReDiff provides differentially edited results with detailed annotations.</p>
